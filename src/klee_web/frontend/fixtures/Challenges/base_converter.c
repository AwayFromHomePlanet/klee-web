//----- BASE CONVERTER -----\\
// This is like the binary challenge except now you have to convert to different bases.
// Your function takes in a number (between 0 and 1000) and a base (between 2 and 10).
// For example: base_converter(312, 4) should return the number 10320 (since this is 312 in base 4).

int base_converter(int n, int base) {
  return 0;
}
